First thing - 
	get the ad stat understood. Does it have the bidding information? will I have to extract the bidding/other info from somewhere else?
	Then export the ones segmented by country and use for training.
	
	How do the break downs work for Twitter anyway?	
	
Second thing - 
	write code to confirm if enough samples exist that have just one country in the break down?
		this is time sensitive.
	If they do, use gender targeting as well. How will the break down work for Twitter in this case?
