Worked on extracting columns from the sample data. We chose columns that could be used for initial training. 
Chosen Columns: 
    Ad Delivery Status
    Automatically Set Bid
    Bid Type
    Budget Pacing
    Max Bid
    Paid Initiative Daily Budget
    Paid Initiative Lifetime Budget
    Clicks/Impressions 
Facing the “scale” problem in MSE, we migrated to using R-Squared as the error statistic. R-squared is a metric used for testing a model prediction ability.
It calculates the ratio of variance captured by the model against the variance in the original data.
We trained the model using non linear relations using the MATLAB code :
link = @(mu) log(mu ./ (1-mu));
derlink = @(mu) 1 ./ (mu .* (1-mu));
invlink = @(resp) 1 ./ (1 + exp(-resp));
F = {link, derlink, invlink};
b = glmfit(X,Y,'binomial','link',F);
The models trained using made some valid predictions for the first time. They were shared on the group and have attached them with the mail.
Best Rsquared result - 0.66
MSE - 3.56E-06
